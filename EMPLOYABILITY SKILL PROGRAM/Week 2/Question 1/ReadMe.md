## Question 1:
         <b>Write a program for given three strings, concatenate the strings in lexicographically increasing order to create a single string.</b><br>
            <b>For example:</b>
                Given firstString = one, secondString = two, thirdString = three, concatenated in lexicographical order, the result = onethreetwo.
